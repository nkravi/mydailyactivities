[My App](https://nkdataviz.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/)


### Project scope

> This is a Data viz project to track some of my daily activities. Using the collected data I have created
> few plots

### Data Collection

> The data for this is collected from **three devices**. 

* Fit Bit
* Time Tracker
* Sleep Time

**Fit Bit** - measures steps I walked each day.

**Time Tracker** - Tracks usage time of various webpages I use.

**Sleep Time** - Sleep time calculates hours I have slept.

### Data Preprocessing

> Some of the data pre-processing includes getting domain name
> from each web url. Combining those with date field etc
> I used python to do data preprocessing

### Data visualization 

> In this I have ploted three plots and given varous selectors such as Date selector, 
> Slidebar and Dropdown to manipulate the graph
